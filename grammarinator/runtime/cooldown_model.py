               during test case generation can affect those that follow.
               The keys of the dictionary are tuples in the form of ``(str, int, int)``, each denoting an alternative:

               specifies the index of the alternation containing the alternative within the rule, and the third element
               specifies the index of the alternative within the alternation (both indices start counting from 0). The
               first and second elements correspond to the ``node`` and ``idx`` parameters of  :meth:`choice`, while
               the third element corresponds to the indices of the ``weights`` parameter.
